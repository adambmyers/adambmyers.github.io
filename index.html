		<h1>My Super Cool Website</h1>

				<p>Hi, this is my super awesome fun web page where the content makes no sense but there is a lot of it. So let's get into some business that you can learn from.</p>

			<h2>This is a list of colors that are colorful in no particular order:</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Red</li>
					<li>Teal</li>
					<li>Purple</li>
					<li>Daffodil</li>
					<li>Lime Green</li>
					<li>Magenta</li>
					<li>Atomic Tangerine</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>This is a list of movies ranked from most-awesome to not-as-awesome</h2>

			<h2>Sometimes people say important things</h2>

					<p>You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.</p>
					<blockquote>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose. - Bill Gates</blockquote>
			
			<h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h2>

					<p>At least, not anymore...</p>

				<h3>Want bold text?</h3>

					<p>There's a <b>wrong</b> way and a right way. <strong>Always</strong> use the right way!</p>
					<p>Maybe you need some <i>italics?</i></p>
					<p>Again, it used to be done like this. This is wrong. This is the <em>right</em> way.</p>


			<h2>Links</h2>
					
					<p>Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from <a href = "https://google.com" target= "_blank">place</a> to place on the internet.</p>
			
			<h2>Sections</h2>
					
					<p>""You miss <span>100 percent</span> of the shots you never take" -Wayne Gretzky" - Michael Scott</p>

 			<div>elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this
